Welcome to Blue Devil Rideshare, a convenient way for Duke students to carpool and help limit the costs of gas money! 

In order to launch this ___(webpage?)___, you must first download Docker.
Download Docker here: https://www.docker.com/get-started

Then, git clone from the git directory at this link: https://github.com/gllewellyn19/Blue-Devil-Rideshare.git

Now use your terminal to cd into that directory and run docker-compose up (docker-compose build too???)

Lastly, go to localhost:8080/rides/ and have fun exploring!
